# Artificial-intelligence-course
This is the course when I take in the third year of my college life.

* The introduction for this course is following:

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses a huge variety of subfields, ranging from the general learning
  and perception to the specific, such as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, driving a car on a crowed street, and diagnosing diseases. This course introduces the foundational principles that drive these applications. Specific topics include search, game playing, Markov decision
  processes, machine learning, graphical models, and logic. The main goal of the course is to equip you with the tools tackle new AI problems you might encounter in life.

* The file of **homework** contains the documents of homework for this course.

* The file of **project1** contains the project of search which include A*, BFS, DFS and so on. And we use these method to solve the problem of 8 puzzle and tic_toc.

* The file of **project2** contains the project of partical filter. In this task I use the feature of Hog and other useful features.

* The file of **project3** contains the project of classify. The teacher ask me to use the method of SVM and Naive Bayes. I also use the method of CNN to imporve the accuracy.

* The file of **img_restore** contains the project of image restore.

* The file of **TSP** contains the method to solve the problem of TSP.
