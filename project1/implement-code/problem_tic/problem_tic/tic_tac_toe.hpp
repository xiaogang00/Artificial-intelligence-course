	You will write a tic tac toc player and play game with this computer player.
	You will use MiniMaxSearch with depth limited strategy. For simplicity, Alpha-Beta Pruning
	is not considered.
	Let's make some assumptions.
	1. The computer player use circle and you use cross.
	2. The computer player is MAX user and you are MIN user.
	3. The miniMaxSearch depth is 3, so that the computer predict one step further. It first
	predicts what you will do if it makes a move and choose a move that maximize its gain.
	4. You play first
