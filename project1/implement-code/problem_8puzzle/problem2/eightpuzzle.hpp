/* Your A* search implementation for 8 puzzle problem
NOTICE:
1. iniState is a 3x3 matrix, the "space" is indicated as -1, for example
	1 2 -1              1 2
	3 4 5   stands for  3 4 5
	6 7 8               6 7 8
2. moves contains directions that transform initial state to final state. Here
	0 stands for up
	1 stands for down
	2 stands for left
	3 stands for right
   There might be several ways to understand "moving up/down/left/right". Here we define
   that "moving up" means to move other numbers up, not move "space" up. For example
   	1 2 -1              1 2 5
	3 4 5   move up =>  3 4 -1
	6 7 8               6 7 8
   This definition is actually consistent with where your finger moves to
    when you are playing 8 puzzle game.
